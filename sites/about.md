Hello, I'm Michael, Software Developer and Scrum Master from Germany. 
My passion is to create high quality software that fits your needs.
I'm experienced in C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. But I'm always try to learn new things and expand my knowledge.
Iâ€™m a big fan of the agile development approach and prefer test driven development.

Let me tell you my story...
===========================

As a child
--------

My passion for computers started early as a child.
When I was around 8 years old I started to build my own computers from old spare parts from my neighbor.
My mother wasn't really enthusiastic about that. But I continued since then.
My first steps into programming wasn't really programming. I've started with scripting languages.
The first things I did were little programs in VBA for Excel and Word.
My first contact with electronics started when I created some layouting components in Eagle for my neighbor.
I started programming microcontroller while building a little Asuro Robot.
I started trying out different programming languages and learned Delphi, C, C++, HTML and PHP over the time.
At the end of school I ended up as the leader of the school homepage group.


As an apprentice
----------------

Directly after school I started my apprenticeship as an IT systems integration specialists.
I've learned a lot of new things about computer systems and data centers.
But at the end of my apprenticeship I've realized that my real passion is software development.
Fortunately I had the opportunity to switch to a new software development department in the same company.
The department was only a year old and I had the chance to shape the department even as an apprentice.
I started to develop Windows CE based software for RFID enabled handhelds to read, analyze and write RFID tags.
I've created the first internal libraries and frameworks to make the development easier and faster.

In the world of work
--------------------

After my apprenticeship I continued working for the same company in the same department.
I was able to do some really interesting RFID based projects. 
The department tried to move on from project based development to developing standard products.
I was lucky to be a part of this change. Creating more complex software, implementing new tools and coding guidelines.
I've got a Scrum Master certificate in that time and adopted the role of the Scrum Master for the department.

New Zealand
-----------

After being in the world of work for over three years I've decided to get a break from the daily working routine.
I packed my backpack and flew straight to New Zealand witch the hope to get work experience in a foreign country, expanding my horizon, and meeting new people.

Present
------

Here I am in New Zealand. Travelling through the country and working on projects.
Every day is full of new experiences and meeting new people.
Become a part of the journey and hire me for a project. 

Private life
============

Besides working as a software developer I do some other things.
I make music with my friends. I play the baritone, trombone and trumpet and sometimes I try something new.
I'm part time self-employed as an event technician.
I'm a christian and volunteer in my local YMCA.
