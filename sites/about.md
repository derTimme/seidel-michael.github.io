Hello, I'm Michael, Softwaredevloper and Scrum Master from Germany. 
My passion is to create high quality software that fits your needs.
I'm experienced in C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. But I'm always try to learn new things and expand my knowledge.

Let me tell you my story...
===========================

As a kid
--------

My addiction to computers started early as a kid.
When I was around 8 years old I started to build my own computers from old spare parts of my neighbour.
My mother wasn't really enthusiastic about that. But I continued since then.
My first steps to programming wasn't really programming. I've started with scripting languages.
The first things I did were little programms in VBA for Excel and Word.
My first contact with electronics started when I created some layouting components in Eagle for my neighbour.
I started programming microcontroller while building a little Asuro Robot.
I started trying out different programming languages and learned Delphi, C, C++, HTML and PHP over the time.
At the end of school I ended up as the leader of the school hompage group.


As an apprentice
----------------

Directly after shool I started my apprenticeship as a IT systems integration specialists.
I've learned a lot of new things about computer systems and data centres.
But at the end of my apprenticeship I've realaised that my real passion is software development.
Fortunately I had the opertunity to switch to a new software development department in the same company.
The deparmtnet was only a year old and I had the fortune to shape the department even as an apprentice.
I started to develop Windows CE based software in RFID enabled handhelds to read, analyize and write RFID tags.
I've created the first internal libraries and frameworks to make the development easier and faster.

In the sphere of action
-----------------------

After my apprenticeship I continued working for the same company in the same department.
I was able to do some really intresting RFID based projects. 
The department tried to move on from project based development to developing standard products.
I was lucky to be a part of this change. Creating more complex software, implementing new tools and coding guidlines.
I've got a Scrum Master certification in that time and adopted the role of the Scrum Master for the department.

New Zealand
-----------

After beeing in the sphere of action for over three years I've decided to get a break from the daily working routine.
I packed my backpack and flew straight to New Zealand witch the hope to expand my horizon, getting work expierence in a foreign country and meeting new people.

Now
---

Here I am in New Zealand. Travelling thruogh the country and working on projects.
Everyday is full of new expierences and meeting new people.
Become a part of the journey and hire me for a project. 
And yes, they have Internet in New Zealand. I'm able to work from anywhere.

Private life
============

Besides working as a software developer I do some other things.
I make music with my friends. I play baritone, trombone, trumpet and sometimes I try something new.
I'm part time self-employed as an event technican.
I'm a christian and volunteer in my local YMCA.
