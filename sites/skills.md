C#
---
In the last years I developed most of the software with C#.
These are some technologies I've used the most: 
- WPF
- WinForms
- Databinding
- WCF
- Unittesting / TDD
- Networking

HTML, CSS & Javascript
----------
With an growing demand on web technologies I've done project with the following technologies among others:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Responsive layout 
- AngularJS
- jQuery
- Node.JS
- Unittesting / TDD

PHP
---
Because you don't always want to setup a dedicated server for a backend service I use PHP in combination with a Framework instead.
- Slim Framework
- Unittesting / TDD
- MySQL


##### And there's more...
... but I don't want to bore you with long lists of skills.
Just ask if you have a project that needs different skills. Or have a look in my [Portfolio](/portfolio/)
Over the time I've done projects in a wide range of programming languages and used a load of tools.
