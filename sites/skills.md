C#
---
In the last years I developed most of the software with C#.
These are some technologies I've used the most: 
* WPF
* WinForms
* Databinding
* WCF
* Unittesting / TDD
* Networking

HTML, CSS & JavaScript
----------
With an growing demand on web technologies I've done projects with the following technologies among others:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Responsive Design 
* AngularJS
* jQuery
* Node.JS
* Unittesting / TDD

PHP
---
Because you don't always want to setup a dedicated server for a backend service I use PHP in combination with a Framework instead.
* Slim Framework
* Unittesting / TDD
* MySQL


##### And there's more...
... but I don't want to bore you with long lists of skills.
Just ask when you have a project that needs different skills. Or have a look in my [Portfolio](/portfolio/)
Over the time I've done projects in a wide range of programming languages and used plenty of tools.
