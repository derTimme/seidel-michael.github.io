short: For my own Homepage I wanted a compromise between a big Content Managament System and uncomfortable static HTML pages. For this I've found the perfect solution with Jekyll.

The requirements for my own Homepage weren't to complicated.

- Update content with a maintainable complexity
- Update the webdesign without recreating the whole page
- Possibility to start a blog
- Simple and clean design
- Responsive design
- No big CMS or Wordpress
- Fast development of the initial site

I didn't want to use a CMS or Wordpress because of two reasons. 
In my opinion these systems are an overkill for my needs and I don't want to waste time with security updates every week.
Using just plain HTML wasn't an option because editing plain HTML sites is to time consuming.

For this I've found the perfect solution - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
With Jekyll you create your page layout in HTML and CSS.
The content of the page is then translated from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files to static HTML pages.

I've used the multi language boilerplate from [Sylvain Durand](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/) as the starting point to save some time.
