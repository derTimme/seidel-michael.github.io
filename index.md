Hello, I’m Michael and I’m looking for work.  
I’m a Software Developer and Scrum Master from Germany. 
My passion is to create high quality software that fits your needs. 
I’m experienced in C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. 
But I’m always try to learn new things and expand my knowledge. 
I’m a big fan of the agile development approach and prefer test driven development.
