#### About 

Hello, I'm Michael, Softwaredevloper and Scrum Master from Germany. My passion is to create high quality software that fits your needs.
I mostly developed software with C# in the past and doing mostly web development with HTML, CSS and Javascript now.
I use the test driven aproach whenever possible.
