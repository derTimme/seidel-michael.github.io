Hello, I'm Michael and I'm looking for work.  
I'm a Softwaredevloper and Scrum Master from Germany. 
My passion is to create high quality software that fits your needs.
I'm experienced in C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. But I'm always try to learn new things and expand my knowledge.
I'm a big fan of the agile development aproach and prefer test driven development.
